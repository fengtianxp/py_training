# Introduction
Here is a repo for training students to learn python and using python to do some programming.

## First step
We need to build the development enviroments. 
* Python 3.10+, This repository contains a collection of materials for teaching/learning Python 3 (3.10+).
* Jupyter Notebook

## Requirements
Have Python 3.10 or newer installed. You can check the version by typing python3 --version in your command line. You can download the latest Python version from here.
Have Jupyter Notebook installed. pip install jupyter is sufficient in most cases.
If you can not access Python and/or Jupyter Notebook on your machine, you can still follow the web based materials. However, you should be able to use Jupyter Notebook in order to complete the exercises.
